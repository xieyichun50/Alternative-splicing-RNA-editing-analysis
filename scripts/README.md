Xie, Y., Chan, P.-L., Kwan, H.-S., Chang, J., 2023. The genome-wide characterization of alternative splicing and RNA editing in the development of <i>Coprinopsis cinerea</i>. J. Fungi 9, 915. https://doi.org/10.3390/jof9090915

Shell and Rscripts used in the analyses.
- Alternative splicing analysis with [CASH](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/19/5/905/3108818). Junction alignment distance (JAD) considered with 6 nt.
- RNA editing analysis with [REDItools v1.0.4](https://github.com/BioinfoUNIBA/REDItools/blob/master/README_1.md#download-reditools). Functional impact of RNA editing was predicted by SnfEff.
- Statistics in R env.
